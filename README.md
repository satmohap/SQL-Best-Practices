# SQL-Best-Practices

This contains the best practices of SQL.  SQL commands generally vary from Database to database . But all of them follow a general standard called ANSI SQL

ANSI SQL is a specification, not a particular product. It's a document, describing the official features of the SQL language.

Every brand of SQL RDBMS implements a subset of ANSI SQL.
